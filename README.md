# 🎮 Welcome to React Arcade!!

**React Arcade** is a small web based arcade built as **my very first group project** while learning about **React** and **TypeScript**. Our goal was simple; to build something fun, creative and achievable while still getting hands on experience with modern frontend tools. To include everyone's ideas, I suggested we each build our own mini games and then bring them together into a one big arcade style web app. This allowed everyone to work independently, stay motivated and explore their own creativity while still delivering a cohesive final product. The arcade features three mini games, each with its own personality and mechanics. The fourth teammated later joined the project and built the review page, completing the overall experience of the arcade.

## 🕹 Emoji Party (My Game)
This is a fast paced emoji matching game with animations and a countdown timer. 
## How It Works: 
⤑ You're given a 3x3 grid of random emojis.

⤑ Click emojis to re roll them.

⤑ Match all emojis to the same one before the timer runs out.

⤑ If the timer runs out, the entire grid turns into ☠️.

⤑ Either you win or lose, you can restart and try again.

## 👩‍💻 My Contributions
I was responsible for designing and building the **Emoji Party** from scratch.
### Key Contributions

⤑ Built the **Emoji Party** game logic using React and TypeScript.

⤑ Created a reusable Emoji component.

⤑ Implemented game states: win,fail,restart.

⤑ Added a countdown timer later on as a stretch goal using useEffect.

⤑ Introduced **animations with Framer Motion** (self taught)

⤑ Helped shaped the overall project structure by suggesting the mini game arcade approach.

## ✨ Frontend Highlights
### Emoji Animations (Framer Motion)
This project was my very **first time using Framer Motion**, which I learnt independently during the development. I wanted my game to be more lively, interactive and fun for users.
### Emojis animate on change using:
⤑ scale in animation.

⤑ smooth spring transitions.
### Animations are handled with:
⤑ motion.span

⤑ AnimatePresence

⤑ Each emoji re renders with unique animation when it changes.

This helped me understand component lifecyles, animating conditional renders and how animations can improve UX without overcomplicating logic.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
### Frontend
⤑ React

⤑ TypeScript

⤑ CSS (inline styling)
### Animation
⤑ Framer Motion
### Routing
⤑ React Router
### State and Logic 
⤑ React Hooks (useState and useEffect)
## 🛠 Tools
⤑ VS code

⤑ Git and GitHub ⤑ for the first time we learnt branching, merging and resolving conflicts.

⤑ npm

## 🚧 Challenges
⤑ Managing game state cleanly; win/fail/timer.

⤑ Understanding React re rendering.

⤑ Resolving Git merge conflicts in group projects.

⤑ Learning Framer Motion without prior animation experience.

## 📚 What I Learned
⤑ How to break a feature into a reusable components.

⤑ How to manage time based logic in React.

⤑ How animations fit into React's rendering model.

⤑ How to collaborate using Git branches.

⤑ How to confidently learn new tools independently. 

## 💡Reflection
My very first group project was a turning point for me. It made it clear for me that **I genuinely wanted to be part of the tech industry long term.** Building this mini game didn't feel like an assignment; if anything, I was very excited and extremely motivated. I found myself sitting at my laptop everyday, eager to keep improving and thinking of ways to make my game more interactive. 

For the first time, I could clearly see myself doing this kind of work everyday; solving problems, building interactive experiences, learning new tools and collaborating with others. This project helped me realise that coding is something I could do for the rest of my life and this is the path I truly want to take. 

That clarity and excitement is what continues to drive my learning and growth as a developer.
